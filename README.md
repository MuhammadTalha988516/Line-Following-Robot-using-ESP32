# Line-Following-Robot-using-ESP32
ESP32-Based Line Following Robot with Real-Time PID Control
Project Overview
This project features the design, implementation, and evaluation of a robust closed-loop control system for an autonomous line-following robot. Built on the ESP32 platform using FreeRTOS, the robot utilizes a five-sensor infrared (IR) array and PID-based control logic to accurately navigate straight paths, curves, and sharp turns in real-time.

Hardware Components
Microcontroller: ESP32
Sensors: 5x Infrared (IR) Sensor Array
Motor Driver: L298N Dual H-Bridge
Actuators: DC Motors (4-wheel chassis)
Power Supply: 12V Battery
Software & Control Logic
Language: C++ (Arduino IDE)
OS: FreeRTOS (Multitasking for concurrent sensor reading and motor control)
Control System: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller
Mathematical Model
The robot calculates the error signal based on the deviation from the line center: e(t) = Desired Position - Measured Position

The PID control law is applied to generate the necessary motor correction: u(t) = Kp*e(t) + Ki∫e(t)dt + Kd(de(t)/dt)

Experimental Tuning Parameters Used:

Proportional Gain (Kp): 1.2
Integral Gain (Ki): 0.01
Derivative Gain (Kd): 0.8
Features
Weighted Average Position Detection: Smooth line tracking using a 5-sensor array.
Locked-Turn Logic: Prevents sensor noise during sharp maneuvers.
Real-Time Processing: FreeRTOS tasks separate sensor polling and PID calculations for optimized timing.
